# Instructions: 
1. Start the program with python
2. Choose between 1v1 and com modes
3. In 1v1, X starts and players take turns alternating on the board
4. In Com, X also starts as the player and the computer will follow as O. Use the grid keypad to play on the board.
5. Play desired amount of matches
6. Press exit when done
# Dependencies: 
tkinter
random
regular python modules
# Future work (What I would do if given more time): 
I would work to understand how to make the computer player smart.
I might even add a scoreboard for multiple games to tally.
As well as fix any bugs I missed or just tidy things up more.
# Completion Statement: 
Almost all of my goals were met! I had a really tough time at first even 
using this library and even switched multiple ideas and libraries before settling on this one.
I very slowly but eventually built the program piece by piece. If it wasn't for Professor 
Penta's good advice and little push I don't even know if I would have been able to get
this far. I wish I could have made a smarter computer player but I am still happy with what
I created given how hard I struggled.
